# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset" obtained from Kaggle, which contains information about various factors related to sleep health and lifestyle habits. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and the application of machine learning techniques to understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on sleep duration and sleep disorders.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about individuals' sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity levels, stress levels, BMI categories, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and whether they have a sleep disorder or not. The dataset contains 374 observations (rows) and 13 variables (columns), including a mix of categorical and numerical variables.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script file.
4. Follow the instructions and code provided in the notebook/script to perform data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning tasks.

## Files

- `sleep_health_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models.
- `sleep_health_dataset.csv`: The Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset used for analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages for the project.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and understanding the variables.
2. **Visualizations**: Creating various visualizations to explore the distributions of key variables and their relationships, such as box plots, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
3. **Machine Learning Techniques**:
   - Linear Regression: Analyzing the relationship between sleep duration and factors like age, gender, stress level, and physical activity level.
   - Decision Tree Classification: Predicting sleep disorders based on age, physical activity level, and stress level.
4. **Recommendations**: Providing recommendations based on the analysis for improving sleep health and overall well-being.
